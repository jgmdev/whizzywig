Whizzywig is easy. It lets people create rich, formatted text through a 
web form. It actually creates xhtml, if you but you need no HTML 
knowledge to use it. If you can use a word processor or email, then you 
can use this. 

Whizzywig is cross-browser: it is written in Javascript, which will run 
in nearly all web browsers. It is lightweight, at 25k, and is the most 
powerful rich text editor for its size. It does not require a Javascript 
library, and works independently of JQuery, MooTools, etc. 

Whizzywig is FREE. Free to copy, free to use and free to change. Free 
for personal use, free for commercial use. See the licence for the 
details. Basically, it says it is FREE.
